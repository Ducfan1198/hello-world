# hello-world
Project Genesis
I am learning to code with the hope of creating new employment opportunities that will allow me to realize my dream of becoming location independent. I am 37 years old with very little exposure to coding, web development or any number of the challenging avenues this path offers. I am looking forward to immersing myself into a field that is entirely new and developing a new skillset that can be used to further my quest for a drastic change in lifestyle.
